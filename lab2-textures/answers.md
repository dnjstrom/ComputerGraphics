# Exercise 1
## What's the point of the index-buffer?
This way we can avoid sending duplicate vertices that are used in many triangles.
In this case, two indices are shared between the two triangles making up the square.

Field of view: the angle-limit of the visible area infront of the camera.
Aspect Ratio: The ratio between the height and width of the orthogonal plane making up the view.
Near plane: The distance to plane onto where the scene is projected.
Far plane: The distance to the plane after which rendering is cut off.
