README:
-------

Here reside precompiled binaries for DevIL and GLEW which are required by the
labs. Binaries are precompiled for the StuDAT computers in the Lab-rooms, and
may not work on your personal computer(s) - for these you may have to rebuild
DevIL and GLEW.

The build scripts check 

	linux/lib64
	linux/lib32

for libraries, and

	linux/include

for headers during configuration. You may replace the files in these locations
with more appropriate versions. Source code for DevIL and GLEW is located in
the linux/ directory:

	linux/glew-1.7.0.tgz
	linux/DevIL-1.7.8.tar.gz

Instructions are below:

- Building DevIL:

 $ tar xvfz DevIL-1.7.8.tar.gz
 $ cd devil-1.7.8
 $ ./configure --prefix="$(cd .. && pwd)" --enable-ILU --enable-ILUT
 $ make && make install

- Building GLEW
 
 $ tar xvfz glew-1.7.0.tgz
 $ cd glew
 $ make GLEW_DEST=".." && make install GLEW_DEST=".."
